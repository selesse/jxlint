## jxlint 1.6.2 (November 12, 2014)

BUG FIXES:

  - Explicitly set UTF-8 encoding in HTML report

BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITIES:
  - Default port changed from 8080 to 8083
  - For a given rule, every file for the validation is now `try/catch`ed. The
    previous behavior was that one exception would cause Jxlint to "give up"

    now automatically appended

## jxlint 1.4.0 (September 2, 2014)

IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Add `andSeverity` to `LintError` build constructor, allowing for the same
  `LintRule` to provide multiple different errors
  - Add experimental option "--web":
    1. When `--web` is selected, Jetty will start up on 8080 and open the
       user's web browser to a webpage
    2. The user is presented with a web page, displaying *all* rules, with a
       check box next to every rule. The user can choose which rules to run,
       and which directory to run on.
    3. When the user selects rules and a directory, then presses "enter", a
       report iframe is generated.

BUG FIXES:

  - Always sort bad option groups before displaying errors
